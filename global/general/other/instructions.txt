[IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS -- PLEASE READ]

The script recommends creating and including the following optional configuration directories/files in some cases:

1. An optional Microsoft fonts directory called "microsoft" in the path "./global/general/fonts/microsoft".

-> If you wish to install Microsoft fonts, provide all the desired .ttf files in this directory.

-> If the directory is not provided, the script will simply ignore this.

2. An optional text file called "trusted-connections-list.txt" containing a list of
trusted connection profile names (one per line) in the path "./global/general/configurations/trusted-connections-list.txt".

-> This file will be used for firewall and DNS/IPv6 hardening to apply the trusted zone and its allowed services to trusted network connections.

-> If the file is not provided, the script will simply ignore DNS/IPv6 configuration and apply restrictive firewall rules
to all network interfaces (will break over-the-LAN apps and services).

-> To harden the network configuration and avoid potential LAN problems, please first connect to all networks you trust (*),
optionally renaming their connection profiles so they are easy to identify.

* To connect to Wi-Fi from CLI:

-> List nearby Wi-Fi networks: nmcli device wifi list

-> Connect to a specific SSID: sudo nmcli device wifi connect "<SSID>" password "<PASSWORD>"

-> To see current connection names: nmcli connection show

-> To change current connection names: sudo nmcli connection modify "<CURRENT-NAME>" con-name "<NEW-NAME>"
